+ [Abbrev](./zip/abbrevv.zip) - A  menu-oriented DOS application to view and maintain a  list  of
abbrevations.
    + Freeware by J R Ferguson for non-commercial purposes.
    + Acronyms may be up to 7 characters long, the description can be any text up to 69 characters.
    + It shows one or more sorted abbrevation lists, allows you to insert, change or delete entries and search for duplicates. 
    + You can also merge two or more abbrevation lists into  a  single  one.
    + The  program  interface  is  quite
intuitive,   offering  mouse  support,  Windows-like menus  and  multiple document subwindows.
    + The program saves its last used settings in a file named ABBREVV.SET, so it can automatically open the same abbrevation file windows the next time you start it.

+ [Acrobat Reader](./zip/acrodos.zip) - The one and only time Adobe, Inc made a PDF viewer for DOS.
    + I have taken care of the installation for you and "registered" it to "FreeDOS User".
    + You can start the program with either *acrodos* or *acrobat*: the two batch files are identical.
    + If you have graphical problems, try *acrodosu* or *acrobatu*: these load the UNIVBE driver before running Acrobat itself. Makes no difference on *my* system, but it might help with really old display cards.
    + Acrobat for DOS can only display PDFs built to an early specification. But there are ways to convert a modern PDF to an older version: see [here](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-convert-pdf-files-to-an-older-format) and [here](https://itstillworks.com/save-pdf-older-version-adobe-6781219.html) for some ideas on the subject. Or you can use [DOSPDF](./zip/dospdf.zip), which you will find described in full in the [command line section](Commandline.md). Finally, you can try [muPDF](./zip/mupdf.zip)
    + in *CONFIG.SYS*, your *FILES=* statement should be at least 20. The FreeDOS default is 40, so that should not be a problem.

![Acrobat](./imgs/acrodos.png)

+ [Ample Notice](./zip/an2.zip) 2.04 - An appointments calendar/alarm clock package that can help organize your life.
    + Shareware by Mark Harris.
    + You enter appointments and notes in any of a variety of natural formats.
    + You can specify that a birthday occurs each July 17, or that you have a meeting every other Tuesday at 4:00 for 5 meetings, or that Father's Day is the third Sunday in June.
    + Appointments which include a time can automatically set a 'pop-up alarm clock' which notifies you at a given advance interval.
    + Different categories of appointments can be tracked for preparation of group meetings or for summaries of specific activities.
    + The sorting and archiving options let you keep track of past activities for business purposes.  Searching for a given appointment (future or past) is fast and easy.
    + Ample Notice is easy to use right away, but is powerful enough to handle a variety of complex applications.
    + Also included is a program for addressing envelopes sideways from data on the screen or from a file.

![an2](./imgs/an2.png)

+ [As-Easy-As](./imgs/aseasy.zip) 5.7 - Spreadsheet
    + In its day, this was THE shareware competitor to Lotus 1-2-3.
    + Now freeware courtesy of Trius, Inc.
    + Packaged as registered to "FreeDOS User" with serial number already filled in (but see the LSM file if you need it for some reason).
    + Also contains the manual in PDF format.

[![ASEASY](./imgs/aseasy.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9a1w8XQD6w AS-Easy-As - click to play)

+ [Aurora](./zip/aurora.zip) - A popular and innovative shareware DOS text editor by Jeff Wunderlich and NText.
    + Aurora utilizes a multi-window, mouse-compatible text mode GUI.
    + Editing functions include column-mode text selection capability, unlimited undo/redo operations, and syntax highlighting.
    + Great macro facilities.
    + The DOS version handles files up to 1 GB in size.
    + Aurora also supports regular expression search/replace operations.
    + Aurora can double quite nicely as a word processor, but it lacks a spell checker.
    + Development of Aurora ceased around 1997.
    + The author has since permitted free registration of the program.
    + This package is preregistered to "FreeDOS User".

![Aurora](./imgs/aurora.png)

+ [Breeze](./zip/breeze.zip) by Kevin Solway - One of the most comprehensive text editors ever written for DOS.
    + Narrowly beats Aurora (above) in that it has a spell-checker. YMMV.
    + Ignore all the shareware documentation: according to the [website](http://www.theabsolute.net/sware/oldfav.html) this is now freeware.
    + Similar programs include [Bingo](./zip/bingo.zip) and [Boxer](./zip/boxer.zip). What is it with text editor programmers and the letter B?

![Breeze](./imgs/breeze.gif)

+ [Cyril](./zip/cyril.zip) - English/Russian text editor
    + This is a very simple word processor designed to allow work in both English and Russian. To allow this, it supports the standard Russian Cyrillic script.
    + Cyril produces text files in Code Page 866. If you work with non-English encodings in DOS, I assume you know how to deal with that.
    + Printer instructions for Bold and Italic are embedded into the text file. Unless you still have an ancient Epson dot-matrix printer, I suggest you don't use them.

![cyril](./imgs/cyril.png)

+ [DataPerfect](./zip/datapfct.zip) 2.6 - A relational database.
    + DataPerfect, originally published by WordPerfect Corp, and later by Novell, was a fast, memory efficient, but capable relational database for DOS. 
    + WordPerfect Corp sold the product alongside their other DOS based office products, such as WordPerfect and PlanPerfect.
    + In 1995 Novell released DataPerfect as freeware and development was continued by its original author, Lew Bastian until about 2008.
    + **Packager's note:** I'll admit, I can't make head or tails of this program, but there are people who swear by it. You can get supporting programs and files [here](https://www.dataperfect.nl/files/).

[![dataperfect](./imgs/datapfct.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXyykFP9tM "DataPerfect - click to play")

+ [DBM](./zip/dbm.zip) -  is a general-purpose database manager. It works in text mode screen with excellent mouse support. DBM also supports user configuration for
  user-defined tasks on specific database files.

![dbm](./imgs/dbm.png)

+ [The Expert](./zip/expert.zip) - Software for the implementation of expert systems.
    It is a framework on which any number of expert systems can be built, and is not itself a single such system.
    + It runs on microcomputers, and runs fast enough to use interactively.
    + The format it requires for a body of knowledge is very simple.
    + Its results (conclusions and their justifications) can be retained for future examination or other use.
    + It works both forward and backward -- either deriving consequences from new data or testing hypotheses put to it as queries -- and these modes can be freely mixed by the user.
    + It can explain what it does -- why it is asking a particular question or how it arrived at a particular conclusion.
    + It allows you to change your input at any time, and immediately re-evaluates all its conclusions.
    + Because it permits chained blocks of knowledge, it is not limited in the complexity of the subjects with which it can deal.
    + It does not require a hard disk or an unusually great amount of memory (128K RAM suffices).
    + Approvalware by Stephen Walton, 1986.

![expert](./imgs/expert.png)

+ [Freebase](./zip/freebase.zip) 1.2 - A free form flat-file database program.

    + Formerly Commercial software by InMagic Inc, now [Freeware](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Inmagic+gives+away+DOS+products+as+freeware%3B+Challenges+Microsoft,...-a019160495).
    + InMagic Plus is designed to help you build, maintain, and use text databases.
    + Included with InMagic are all the tools you need to: define a database, load and retrieve information, create reports, keep your databases healthy, and more.
    + This was a serious product in its time: it sold for around $1000 and dominated the libraries market.

![inmagic](./imgs/inmagic.png)

+ [Intermem Professional](./zip/impro.zip) - Schedule keeper / diary
    + Freeware by  Jeff Goke
    + INTERMEM Professional reminds you of upcoming events.
    + Also warnings may appear reminding you an event is scheduled to occur in x days.
    + If you wish to enter/edit an event type *IMPRO* at the DOS prompt to run INTERMEM.
    + IMPRO uses a DOS GUI Interface to make INTERMEM as easy to use as possible.
    + If you just wish to see what is coming up, type *IMPRO -a*.
    + In this FreeDOS package, if you want to put *IMPRO -a* in AUTOEXEC.BAT, use the CALL command, or nothing after it will be processed.
    + The first time you run INTERMEM -a it will complain about overdue appointments. Just click on "Done and Update". Then enter the main program and weed out the ones you don't want.

![impro](./imgs/impro.png)

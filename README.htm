<h2> <a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
</p><p>
This is a repository of <a href="http://www.freedos.org/">FreeDOS</a>-compatible freeware and OSS software. Not "abandonware", by which I mean that you will not find formerly commercial software here that have not been explicitly made open-source or at least freeware.
</p><p>
However, non-crippled shareware with a single nag screen at the beginning or end is fair game. Whether you are going to try to send money to a developer from thirty or forty years ago who could be dead by now is up to you.
</p><p>
Having said all that, there are a lot of little utilities from a kinder, gentler age, when people would just make their stuff available without worrying about licenses. These will be regarded as public domain until someone informs me otherwise.
</p><p>
Source code is included wherever possible.
</p><p>
This is not meant to be a conclusive collection of DOS applications. These are apps that I have tested on <em>FreeDOS 1.2</em> (on bare silicon and in the <em>DOSBox</em> emulator) and that I find useful, fun or interesting. If you need something more comprehensive, try <a href="http://reimagery.com/fsfd/">this site</a> or <a href="https://www.opus.co.tt/dave/indexall.htm">this one</a>. I am not a gamer at all, so if that is what you are looking for, well, sorry, I only have a few of the simplest ones.
</p><p>
An example: FreeDOS comes with DosZip Commander. I use it all the time. And if you don't like that one, it also has DOS Navigator. There are dozens of Norton Commander clones out there: Directory Maven, Volkov Commander, you name it. But generally one is only going to end up in this repository if it offers a clear difference to and advantage over Doszip Commander.
</p><p>
Since I started this site, some apps have been incorporated into the FreeDOS installation itself. I'll weeed them out if I see that happening.
</p><p>
</p><p>
I also slip in a few little apps that <a href="My<em>apps.md">I wrote myself</a>. You will know them by a certain primitive look and feel &#9786

<h2> <a name="Installation"></a>To install these packages:</h2>
</p><p>
Download the package, transfer it to your FreeDOS system and extract the zip file to the <strong>ROOT directory</strong> (C:&#92). 
</p><p>
<pre><code><p style=background-color:LightGray;>unzip packagename.zip -d c:\</code></pre>
</p><p>
You might be tempted to use the <em>DosZip Commander</em>, which is bundled with FreeDOS and can be called up with the command <em>dz</em>, or similar utilities. I advise against this. These packages were actually created under Linux and you may come across weird crc errors if you use <em>dz</em> or similar apps. The command line works fine.
</p><p>
<em>It is important to extract these packages to the root directory!</em> This is different from official FreeDOS packages, wich expect to be extracted to <em>C:\FDOS</em>. There is an actual reason for this. Some of these very old programs are not relocatable: They have hardcoded paths inside them and will crash or refuse to load if you try to run them from a strange directory. I have tried really hard to stick to the FreeDOS file system and not litter your root with directories, but sometimes I simply can't. Better then, to have a single installation procedure for all my packages.
</p><p>
Programs that do not run directly from <em>c:\FDOS\BIN</em> will have a convenient batch file placed in <em>C:\FDOS\LINKS</em>. If a program requires changes to <em>CONFIG.SYS</em> or <em>AUTOEXEC.BAT</em>, that will be documented here. 
</p><p>
Sorry, there is no uninstall facility. But most of these packages consist of a single directory in C:\FDOS\PROGS (or C:\FDOS\DEVEL), a batch file in C:\FDOS\LINKS and an information file in C:\FDOS\APPINFO, so it shouldn't be too hard.

Please understand: I don't actually know all these languages. Where possible, I ran the included test suites or compiled some example code. If I could find documentation, I included it. But basically you are on your own here.

+ [@Compare](./zip/@compare.zip) 1.8 - A diff program for DOS by Brian C Madsen.
    + @Compare works on Ascii files which are roughly similar to each other (e.g. a .PAS and its .BAK file; a document and an earlier version of the same document; or data created via double data entry.)
    + Files to be compared may be of unlimited length.
    + @Compare matches up the two files, displaying them side by side, and displaying the similarities and differences between them.
    + Equal lines are marked by an equal sign on both sides of the screen; discrepancies in similar but unequal lines are highlighted; and lines which exist in one file and which have no corresponding counterpart in the other file are displayed as such.
    + Does not work in DOSBox. If your version of DOS does not allow executable filenames starting with "@" just rename @COMPARE.EXE to COMPARE.EXE.

    + It includes pop-up tables, column support, macro key, undo, copy & paste to Windows applications, long filenames, word wrap, spell checker & thesaurus (English only, as far as I can make out), HTML support, and much more.
    + Freeware by Goldshell Digital Media.
    + In the Pedit package there's a file called PEDITLGT.EXE. This is the Light version of Pedit.  It's Pedit stripped of several options.
    + The purpose for this is to offer an editor which can easily be included on rescue floppies and such.
    + The omitted options are:
        + Spell checker.
        + Thesaurus.
        + Printing through Windows.
    + The remaining functionality is the same.
    + Also includes INSPECT, a hex editor.

+ [Rational Pilot (RAP)](./zip/rap.zip) - A batch file replacement language
    + Freeware by the Summer Institute of Linguistics.
    + It is a full-featured programming language designed for building user-friendly applications from a collection of stand-alone programs.
    + It can be viewed as a replacement for MS-DOS's batch processor which offers the following added features:
        + extensive string-handling primitives,
        + structured programming constructs,
        + built-in mechanism for displaying menus and handling user's responses,
        + and a wide range of primitives for testing the state of the file system so that user-proof programs can be written.
    + A common library of RAP subroutines is also included.

+ [SmallADA](./zip/smallada.zip) - A subset of the ADA language, with an IDE.
    + Freeware for noncommercial use by George Washington University.
    + This is a compiler/interpreter for a part of the Ada language, namely the "Pascal subset" plus the Ada tasking support.
    + It is not intended ever to be a full Ada compiler, rather a vehicle for teaching, learning, and experimenting with concurrent programming.
    + The compiler is quite fast, producing P-code which is then interpreted by the interpreter.
    + The entire system runs in RAM with no disk accesses, so expect capacity to be limited. 250 statements or so can be safely accommodated.
    + The current version is not particularly robust, rather it is a preliminary step toward effective window-oriented monitoring of task execution.

![Smallada](./imgs/smallada.png)

+ [SNOBOL 4](./zip/snobol.zip) - A freeware implementation of the SNOBOL language by Gordon E Peterson II.

    + Free for noncommercial use.
    + XLISP is an experimental programming language combining some of the features of Common Lisp with an object-oriented extension capability.
    + It was implemented to allow experimentation with object-oriented programming on small computers.

+ [XST BASIC](./zip/xst.zip) - A DOS Basic interpreter with C emitter.
